Health For Life

	Health and fitness are important factors in everyday life.  A huge factor that plays into overall health is weight gain, which will inevitably lead to obesity.  The cause of weight gain is generally caused by overeating or binge-eating.  Being over-weight or obese can lead to the chance of getting these health problems: sleep apnea, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and arthritis.  The application I will be creating will help people determine their overall calorie intake and whether they want to be in a deficit or surplus.
	The data that the application will collect is going to be personal information regarding body weight, neck, waist, neck, and hip measurements.   The data will be used to measure the user’s lean body mass and fat mass.  The user will be prompted to determine how much fat loss will be lost, total body weight loss required, rate of loss, weight loss per week, and deficit duration.  The user will also input personal information to create a profile, which will consist of their name, age, and gender.

	The graphical user interface (GUI) will consist of a sign-in screen, a home page, and four different tabs.  The home page will contain all the user’s information regarding their current total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), basal metabolic rate (BMR), fat mass (FM), and lean body mass (LBM).  One tab will be for re-inputting the user’s information, which will consist of text boxes that prompt the user for weight, neck, waist, and hip measurements.  There will be a button that allows the user to submit their information.  The second tab of the GUI will have four different buttons for the type of diet the user would like to be on, which are maintenance, cutting, bulking, and reverse-dieting.  The third tab of the GUI will be for settings, which will allow the user to adjust their personal information regarding their name, gender, and birthdate.  This page will also allow the user to create additional profiles, in case there are other users on the same application.  The fourth tab of the GUI will contain a list of food that is calorie-dense in micro and macro-nutrients.  This will be a general page to refer to for dieting and what foods to eat.
  
	For processing logic, the application will process the user’s initial inputs and plug them into equations, which will determine the user’s TDEE, BMR, FM, LBM, daily calorie intake, and weekly calorie intake.  The program will take the user’s input for their diet type and will output the different calorie intake levels that are available to the user.  The information altogether will conclude the rate at which the user needs to be consuming their specific calorie intake to hit their goal weight.
	In conclusion, the application will assist with educating the general public on how important keeping track of their calorie intake is for weight loss, maintenance, and gain.  The application will have a user-friendly GUI which will process the user’s inputs to output calorie goals.  Health and fitness are two factors that play roles in preventing chronic diseases such as obesity and binge-eating.
