Web applications and graphical user interface (GUI) are used worldwide.  Web applications are targeted to make human lives much easier and simpler.  Comparing today’s consumers to those of old, consumers now prefer to use applications such as Netflix or Hulu to stream, instead of driving out to a Blockbuster or HollywoodVideo to rent a movie.   Similar applications that have since been created include Instagram, Facebook, and Google.

Instagram utilizes data by collecting the user’s information such as their name, email, password, personal preferences, contacts, phone number, location, and username.  The GUI consists of a picture layout that consists of different pages, such as the home, camera, search, likes, and personal profile.  The processing logic for Instagram is to prompt users to first create a profile with a username and their personal information.  The user is then prompted to follow other pages or tags, which will populate pictures and videos into their home page, which contains a feed.  The user is also prompted to upload their own media.  Instagram also takes the data from what pages and tags the user follows and populates advertisements.

Facebook is very similar to Instagram in the sense that the application requires a profile to use it.  Data is collected from the user in Facebook by prompting the user to input their personal information, personal preferences, to import contacts from their phone, the user’s phone number, and location.  Facebook then prompts the user to add friends, which will either be a list built from their contacts or the pages the user followed and liked.  The GUI consists of a home screen with a feed displaying posts from pages the user follows and friends that were added.  The GUI additionally has tabs for Groups, Marketplace, the user’s personal profile, notifications, and overview.  The user can post or share text, pictures, and videos to their feed, which will populate on both their homepage and timeline.  The processing logic for Facebook is to prompt the user to create a profile, which the user will use to add friends, follow pages, and join groups from.  Facebook then produces advertisements based off the pages the user follows and likes.

Google collects data by tracking searches, what search results are clicked on, web crawling, analytics, ad serving, and DNS lookup.  Google stores this data and utilizes it to show popular search results or advertisements based off what users most commonly use.  Google’s GUI consists of a search bar, tabs for home, search activity, collections, and settings.  Google’s processing logic is to prompt the user to input text into a search bar and for the user to hit enter, which will then populate search results based off each word.

To conclude, web applications have made art, communication, and answers easier to access for the common consumer or user.  Such web applications are Instagram, Facebook, and Google.
